The paper that I wrote titled "Towards assessing agricultural land suitability with causal machine
learning" was accepted at the [Earthvision](https://www.grss-ieee.org/events/earthvision-2022/)
workshop of [CVPR 2022](https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/)!

This is a culmination of the work we have been doing at the National Observatory of Athens
to bring modern data-driven decision-making in sustainable agriculture 
(see [post](https://ggiannarakis.github.io/blog/cates-for-agri/)).

In this proof of concept, we focused on the Flanders region of Belgium, employed 
large-scale geospatial data, and modeled the heterogeneous impact of
two sustainable agricultural practices on the productivity of land with 
[double machine learning](https://econml.azurewebsites.net/spec/estimation/dml.html).

**Earthvision** is a targeted workshop for the **AI4EO** community. It is organized for the 3rd consecutive
year, frequently featuring prominent researchers and institutions of the field.
Accepted Earthvision papers are included in the CVPR 2022 workshop proceedings
and published in IEEE Xplore.

Here's a screenshot of my workshop presentation!
