Hello, and welcome!

My name is Georgios Giannarakis and I am a Data Scientist. Here is my CV:

[Curriculum Vitae (single page)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FjkaIg9TJSS2ChEmNkYeZHclWcPsJqcz/view)

I work as a Research Data Scientist at the National Observatory of Athens. My background is in Applied Mathematics. I am interested in all things data science, with a special passion for Experimentation and Causal Inference. I have created this website to develop and present my professional world. This includes data science blogging, projects, news and more!

## More on experience

(2020) In the Netherlands, I worked as a Data Science Research Intern at photolithography leader ASML. I took up a challenging project that aimed at unveiling hidden interactions within ASML machines through the use of Causality. I created a framework for benchmarking causal inference methods and researched the estimation of one of them in non-stationary data.

(2018) As a Data Science Intern at Dutch start-up Optiply, I analyzed supply chain data. The analysis culminated with a new metric I developed that quantified customer behavior; this was related to customer churn and contributed to business intelligence. I also created an automated routine that generates a report featuring personalized quantitative insights for each customer.

## More on education
  
My scientific foundation was set in Athens, where I obtained the B.Sc. in Mathematics (2016) from the University of Athens, receiving a rich and diverse mathematical education. I specialized in Probability and Statistics, while taking many courses in Analysis - a field still close to my heart.

I continued at a postgraduate level in The Netherlands, earning the M.Sc. in Industrial and Applied Mathematics (2020) from the Eindhoven University of Technology. TU/e offered me an ideal combination of high quality academic training and professional opportunities to apply it - a blend I actively sought. I extended my Statistics knowledge while specializing in Machine Learning and Causality.

## More on interests
  
My professional goal is to provide stakeholders with actionable insights by utilizing data in a scientific manner. I am interested in achieving that in a variety of industries with a preference for socially impactful positions. 

Hence, Statistics and Machine Learning are my main professional interests alongside their related tasks: cleaning, exploring, and modeling data. At the same time, inferring and incorporating causal knowledge into AI is of increasing importance, and Causality is a field I am passionate about.

I am equally invested in the engineering side of things. Good coding practices, version control, Big Data ecosystems, Cloud environments, MLOps, Data Engineering are examples of skills I like to actively develop.

## Personal note

I consider balance to be a virtue that an individual acquires via exposure to a diverse set of experiences; striking such a balance is a life goal of mine. I have worked at a leading tech company using cutting edge science, studied at a top technical university, brewed cofee for customers at a café, created videos while serving in the army. While not a coherent body of activities, I cherish each of them separately for directing me in life, and most of all for teaching me to perceive adversity as opportunity; to have a growth mindset.

Out of office, I like cooking or mixing a cocktail. I enjoy going to the movies, preferably outdoors. I consider art to be very important, especially music. I like going swimming when given the chance. I find the “think global, act local” motto very wise. Above all, I value spending quality time with people I love. -->
