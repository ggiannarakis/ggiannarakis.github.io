Microsoft Research has developed several prominent opens-source tools for causality.
Yesterday, they organized a community workshop for the tools they have developed.
It was held online, featuring renowned researchers and a large audience.

At the National Observatory of Athens, we are interested in using causal machine learning 
for sustainable agricultural decision-making (see relevant post). In our work,
we have in fact primarily used Microsoft's EconML for CATE estimation.

Following a one-on-one call with Microsoft Researchers, we were selected to present in the
Breakout Discussions part of the workshop, representing the sustainability sector.

I thus gave a short talk, sketching our work and the need for causality in agricultural decision-making.
A fruitful discussion followed, moderated by Eleanor Dillon, Principal Economist at Microsoft Research, 
and Alberto Arribas Herranz, Microsoft's Sustainability Science Lead for Europe.

And since the breakout discussions were unfortunately not recorded, here's a screenshot from my
presentation!
