I am delighted to share that the paper I led titled 
["Personalizing Sustainable Agriculture with Causal Machine Learning"](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/112) 
won the Best Proposal Paper award at the ["Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning" 
NeurIPS 2022 Workshop](https://www.climatechange.ai/events/neurips2022).

The paper was selected as best among 19 proposal papers that applied Machine Learning to solve
climate change related issues in novel ways. They included work done at top institutions 
such as [MIT](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/111), 
[Microsoft](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/103)
and [ETH Zurich](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/96).

I am pleased that our work was awarded the prize, and that causality is evidently appreciated in such
reputable venues. The paper co-authors are: Vasileios Sitokonstantinou, Roxanne Lorilla, Charalampos Kontoes.
