An interactive Tableau visualization showing the geographic distribution and other attributes 
of the hotels taking part in the “Tourism for all 2021” program
sponsored by the Greek state.

{% include gallery caption="Left: Part of the visualization. Right: The island of Cephalonia.
Visualizing the accommodations allows for easier exploration of vacation options." %}

An excel sheet from the official program webpage containing location data and various attributes 
per residence was used. The visualization provides (among others) the name, contact number, 
and price per night for each hotel that satisfies certain constraints set by the user. 
Its design is inspired from airbnb.
