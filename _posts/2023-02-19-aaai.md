Farmers frequently worry about the right time to sow their fields;
post-sowing weather conditions can make or break their final produce.
To help a local agriculture cooperative decide, we used weather predictions 
and domain knowledge to develop a sowing support system for cotton crops.
Wondering how good did we do, we then used causal inference to assess
the incremental impact of our product on the yield the farmers observed.

Really enjoyed working on this project that is currently being scaled-up
to other crops and areas in Greece, delivering proven value to its users.
