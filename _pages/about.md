I am a Senior Data Analyst at Plum Fintech.
My background is in applied mathematics. I am interested in all things data science, with a special
passion for experimentation and causal inference.

I obtained the B.Sc. in Mathematics from the [University of Athens](https://en.math.uoa.gr/)
in Greece, and the M.Sc. in Industrial and Applied Mathematics from the
[Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/)
in the Netherlands. While in the Netherlands I 
interned at e-commerce startup [Optiply](https://optiply.co.uk/) and [ASML](https://www.asml.com/en), 
Europe's largest tech company.
After fulfilling my mandatory military service in Greece, I worked at the 
[National Observatory of Athens](https://github.com/Agri-Hub)
where I developed and improved digital products for sustainable agriculture.
I then joined [HP](https://www.hp.com/us-en/home.html) where I used data science
to drive growth in an e-commerce setting. As of mid 2025 I am a senior data analyst at [Plum](https://withplum.com/), 
immersing myself into the exhilarating world of fintech.

[//]: # (to a diverse set of experiences; striking such a balance is a life goal of mine. )

[//]: # (While not a coherent body of activities, I cherish each of them separately for directing me in life, )

[//]: # (and most of all for teaching me to perceive adversity as opportunity; to have a growth mindset.)

Out of office, I like cooking or mixing a cocktail. I enjoy going to the movies, 
preferably outdoors. I consider art to be very important, especially music. 
I will go swimming when given the chance. I find the “think global, act local” motto very wise. 
Above all, I value spending quality time with people I love.
