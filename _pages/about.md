Out of office, I like cooking or mixing a cocktail. I enjoy going to the movies, 
preferably outdoors. I consider art to be very important, especially music. 
I will go swimming when given the chance. I find the “think global, act local” motto very wise. 
Above all, I value spending quality time with people I love.
