The paper that I led titled "Towards assessing agricultural land suitability with causal machine
learning" was accepted at the Earthvision workshop of CVPR 2022!

This is a culmination of the work we have been doing at the National Observatory of Athens
to bring modern data-driven decision-making in sustainable agriculture (see here).

In this proof of concept, we focused on the Flanders region of Belgium, employed 
large-scale geospatial data, and modeled the
heterogeneous impact of two sustainable agricultural practices on the productivity of land
with double machine learning.

Earthvision is a targeted workshop for the AI4EO community. It is organized for the 3rd consecutive
time, frequently featuring prominent researchers and institutions of the field.
Accepted Earthvision papers are included in the CVPR 2022 workshop proceedings
and submitted to IEEE for publication in IEEE Xplore.
