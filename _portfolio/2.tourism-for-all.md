An interactive Tableau visualization showing the geographic distribution and other attributes 
of the hotels taking part in the “Tourism for all 2021” program
sponsored by the Greek state (work in progress).

{% include gallery caption="Visualizing the data of accomodations allows for 
easier exploration of vacation options." %}

A dataset from the official program webpage containing location data and various attributes 
per residence was used. The visualization provides the name, contact number, and price per night 
for each hotel that satisfies certain constraints set by the user.
