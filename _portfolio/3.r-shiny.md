In preparation for my internship at Optiply, I developed a simple
R Shiny web app that automatically fits ARIMA and Exponential Smoothing
models to selected Time Series featured in R. The app provides and plots forecasts.
It also performs a short residual analysis.

{% include gallery caption="Screenshot of the application. Numerical forecasts are reported
and plotted." %}

Users can visualize and compare different models that are automatically fit. 
They can also select the number of months to forecast for three pre-selected time series, ranging from
1 to 24 months ahead.
