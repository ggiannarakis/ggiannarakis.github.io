I am happy to share the highlights from the inaugural Athens Causal Data Science Meetup. This meetup marked the beginning of a journey into the realm of causality in data science, bringing together industry experts, academics, and enthusiasts alike.

The Athens Causal Data Science Meetup was conceived to unite data professionals fascinated by causality's pivotal role in decision-making. Whether exploring A/B testing, quasi-experiments, or observational approaches, the meetup aimed to foster learning and networking opportunities.

The event commenced with a warm [welcome](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dPWXJaa28_JhnBBToAwemzT_Z2b5HfZ5tyorehIaygs/edit) and introductions, setting the stage for three talks:

1. **Causality in Marketing**
   - Presented by myself, delving into how causal techniques enhance decision-making in [marketing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QNAilZbfFHGeTc8JWwF_tF0cIRBSUanyt7U_9YsJwig/edit#slide=id.gd9c453428_0_16) strategies.
   - I prefaced my talk with a brief [introduction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GCUw35LdLxDJAnif9VUCqFc5EavlzkrXEcAEHf6bizY/edit#slide=id.g2e159a429b0_1_0) to causality within data science.

2. **Causality in Pest Management**
   - Presented by Ilias Tsoumas, Data Scientist at NOA & PhD(c) Wageningen University.
   - Ilias shared applications of causality in [agricultural](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ruUljuhXRTnM8yeQrgP4pYUeVVZHEFZq7JQPNFVTm84/edit#slide=id.p) contexts, specifically in pest management.

3. **Causality in Clinical Development**
   - Presented by Andrew Rainboldt & Gerry Liaropoulos, Data Scientists at Intelligencia AI.
   - Andrew and Gerry discussed leveraging causal methodologies in clinical trials and healthcare research.
