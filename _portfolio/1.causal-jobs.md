Causal-jobs is a project dedicated to revealing 
the status of causal inference in the European job market.
It is based on automatically parsing job alert emails generated by "causal inference" as a search term.

Since May 12, 2022, every EU vacancy that contains this term is extracted from the corresponding email, 
transformed into an analysis-ready dataframe, and loaded into a postgresql database living in a Docker container.
This is done via an ETL pipeline that runs daily. Once a week, a html report is then automatically generated
by analyzing the data and deployed on GitHub pages. 
The report contains the latest causal-jobs vacancies, as well as company names and other relevant info.

The GitHub repo also contains a step-by-step guide in case you would like to set up your own causal-jobs project, 
e.g. to change the analysis, focus on another region or even consider another search term.
