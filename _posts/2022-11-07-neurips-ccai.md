This December, I will be participating as the first author of two accepted papers 
at the ["Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning" workshop](https://www.climatechange.ai/events/neurips2022),
organized by [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/) as part of [NeurIPS 2022](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2022).

[Paper #1: Personalizing Sustainable Agriculture with Causal Machine Learning](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/112)

➡ In our first work, we propose the use of causal machine learning for understanding the impact of
sustainable agriculture in terms of local conditions. In that way, we can efficiently uplift green metrics
and contribute to the sustainable intensification of agriculture. Here we focus on understanding
how much is Soil Organic Carbon driven by eco-friendly management practices.

[Paper #2: Evaluating Digital Tools for Sustainable Agriculture using Causal Inference](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/neurips2022/72)

➡ In our second work, we use causal inference to assess the added value of a smart farming tool on the 
yield that farmers observed. To do so, we create a causal graph of the farm system and employ the
backdoor criterion for identifying the effect of interest. We believe such work can benefit 
the transparency of the digital agriculture market and aid agtech adoption.

Both works demonstrate the potential of causal AI for improving decision-making in agriculture. 
I am really glad to share that they were both selected for a spotlight presentation 
(top 10% of [accepted papers](https://www.climatechange.ai/events/neurips2022#accepted-works)).

During the past 3 years, the "Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning" workshop
has been part of the largest AI conferences of the world, including NeurIPS, ICML and ICLR. 
It features short papers with self-published proceedings, and attracts a large, diverse group of attendees from
both the industry and academia. This year, 112 papers were accepted, including works from MIT, Google, Microsoft
and others.
