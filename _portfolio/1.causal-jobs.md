Causal-jobs is a jobs analytics project dedicated to revealing 
the status of causal inference in the European job market.
It is based on a daily ETL pipeline that parses job alert emails 
generated by "causal inference" as a search term.
Then, once a week a html report analyzing the data is automatically generated and uploaded.
The report contains the latest causal-jobs vacancies, as well as company names,
location data and other relevant information.

Here is a high-level view of the architecture:

And here is a Wordcloud generated from all existing causal job titles (as of late June 2022). 
While the Data Scientist role popularity seems to be levelling off in the broader data landscape,
it still dominates jobs that contain the term "causal inference" in the description.
More insights on the report!
