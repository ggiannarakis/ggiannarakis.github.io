This August I joined HP Inc. as a Data Scientist! I am happy to work on such a well-established and
successful company within a fully-remote team that is distributed across the world.

I will be applying experimentation, causality, and machine learning techniques to answer questions
that are important from the business perspective and interesting from the scientific one.

This includes tasks such as understanding the incremental impact of ad campaigns, optimizing the customer
journey on the HP store, root-cause analyses and more.
