It's 2022 and the causal revolution is gaining serious traction. AI gurus are advocating
for the [inclusion of causal reasoning in AI systems](https://spectrum.ieee.org/understanding-causality-is-the-next-challenge-for-machine-learning) 
and posit causality as [the next frontier for AI](https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/10/27/1037134/data-science-challenges-trustworthy-ai/). 
The [citations of prominent figures of the field](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=bAipNH8AAAAJ&hl=en) are soaring.

As you hear researchers raving, you might however be wondering: **is the industry ready for it?**

This is a question I've been asking myself for a long time.
Sure, all these new conferences and perspective papers on causality definitely confess that 
there is indeed something big going on in the research community. But is the industry keeping up?

This is why I decided to pursue the _causal-jobs_ project. I wanted to know **who & where is looking
to hire you for your causal knowledge**. I wanted a persistent database of causal vacancies that
is automatically augmented with the most recent jobs posted on the internet. From this, I wanted
to analyze the data and find patterns in terms of **countries, companies, or even the actual
job titles that contain "causal inference"** somewhere in the job description.

**And you can now find out too!** Thanks to a daily ETL process I have developed,
most of the _causal-jobs_ posted on the internet will end up on a database that is
automatically analyzed once a week, producing a report with all the relevant insights.
For now, only jobs posted anywhere in the European Union are included.

So, if you do have (or planning to invest time in) causal skills, _do_(check) the most recent
version of the report! For more info, 
take a look at the [Portfolio project](https://ggiannarakis.github.io/portfolio/1.causal-jobs/).
