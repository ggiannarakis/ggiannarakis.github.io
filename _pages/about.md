[//]: # (add video / slides / paper where needed)

I work as a Data Scientist at the National Observatory of Athens.
My background is in Applied Mathematics.
I am interested in all things data science, 
with a special passion for experimentation and causal inference.
For more, see my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ggiannarakis/).

I obtained the B.Sc. in Mathematics from the [University of Athens](https://en.math.uoa.gr/)
in Greece, and the M.Sc. in Industrial and Applied Mathematics from the
[Eindhoven University of Technology](https://www.tue.nl/en/our-university/departments/mathematics-and-computer-science/)
in the Netherlands. While studying in the Netherlands I 
interned at e-commerce startup [Optiply](https://optiply.co.uk/) and semiconductor leader 
[ASML](https://www.asml.com/en).
After graduating and fulfilling my mandatory military service in Greece, I joined
the National Observatory of Athens in September 2021.

Out of office, I like cooking or mixing a cocktail. I enjoy going to the movies, 
preferably outdoors. I consider art to be very important, especially music. 
I will go swimming when given the chance. I find the “think global, act local” motto very wise. 
Above all, I value spending quality time with people I love.
