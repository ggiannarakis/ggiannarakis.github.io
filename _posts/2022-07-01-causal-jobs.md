It's 2022 and the causal revolution is gaining serious traction. AI gurus are advocating
for the inclusion of causal reasoning in AI systems, the citations of prominent figures
of causality are soaring, and causality is included in the next wave of AI.

As you hear researchers raving, you might however be wondering: is the industry ready for it?

This is a question I've been asking myself for a long time now. Fragmented evidence here and there
from social media, job boards, success stories was indicative that there is indeed something
going on, but it was by no means conclusive evidence of wide popularity.

This is why I decided to pursue the causal-jobs project. I wanted to know who & where is looking
to hire you for your causal knowledge. I wanted a persistent database of causal vacancies that
is automatically augmented with the most recent jobs posted on the internet. From this, I wanted
to analyze the data and find patterns in terms of countries, companies, or even the actual
job titles that contain "causal inference" somewhere in the job description.

You can now find out too! Thanks to a simple ETL process I have developed and runs daily,
most of the causal-jobs posted on the internet will end up being written to a database that is
automatically analyzed once a week, producing a report featuring various insights. The report
(and code) are openly available on GitHub.
